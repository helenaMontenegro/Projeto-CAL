# CAL 2017/2018

Curricular Unity: CAL - Algorithm Design and Analysis <br>
Lective Year: 2017/2018

Programming Language: C++

Developed in collaboration with Maria Viana and Sim√£o Oliveira.

We implemented a program that finds the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm. The program includes points that represent roads, parking lots and gas stations. The user can choose not only the where he starts and the road he wants to go to, but also it he wants to pass through a gas station or not, in the way.

The map is read from txt files that have all the points of interest of the map and the links between them.
